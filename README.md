# Continuous Integration/continuous deployment demo

We'll use [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org) to run our tests and deploy to Heroku if the tests pass each time we push to `master`.


## Checklist

* Ensure Travis CI has access to the user account/org
* Switch on the repository on the [profile](https://travis-ci.org/profile/pohutukawa-2016)
* Add a `.travis.yml` file
* Install the Travis CI and the Heroku CLI tools
* Add the required settings in the `.travis.yml` file
* Push to GitHub
